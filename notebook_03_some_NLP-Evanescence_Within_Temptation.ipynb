After that we used Spotify API to retrieve more details about both bands including information about them, their albums, and details about their lyrics including not only metadata (e.g. ) but also audio features (e.g. valence, energy, tempo, liveness) [notebook_02_retrieve_Spotify_data-Evanescence_Within_Temptation.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Project_Evanescence_Within_Temptation/notebook_02_retrieve_Spotify_data-Evanescence_Within_Temptation.ipynb).\n",

    "3. I'll try also to connect metadata of tracks with the sentiment provided by lyrics to draw conclusions.\n",
