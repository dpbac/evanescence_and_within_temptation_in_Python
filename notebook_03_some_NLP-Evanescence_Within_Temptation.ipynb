After that we used Spotify API to retrieve more details about both bands including information about them, their albums, and details about their lyrics including not only metadata (e.g. ) but also audio features (e.g. valence, energy, tempo, liveness) [notebook_02_retrieve_Spotify_data-Evanescence_Within_Temptation.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Project_Evanescence_Within_Temptation/notebook_02_retrieve_Spotify_data-Evanescence_Within_Temptation.ipynb).\n",

    "In what concerns NLP (Natural Language Processing) I want to do some things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text analysis: Analyze both bands and compare them through their lyrics using some metrics and word clouds.\n",
    "2. Sentiment analysis: Explore the sentiment, polarity, and subjectivity of the lyrics provided by [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html) to compare both bands through visualization.\n",
    "3. I'll try also to connect metadata of tracks with the sentiment provided by lyrics to draw conclusions.\n",
    "4. Analyse some of the audio features, in special the ones that have been pointed as mood features, i.e., valence and energy, and see if there is a relation between them and the sentiment of lyrics of a track.\n",
