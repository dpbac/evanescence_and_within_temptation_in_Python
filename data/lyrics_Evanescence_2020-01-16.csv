solitude,"How many times have you told me. you love her. As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth. How long have I stood here beside you. I live through you. You looked through me. Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. How many times have I done this to myself. How long will it take before I see. When will this hole in my heart be mended. Who now is left alone but me. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true. Everyone leave me stranded. Forgotten, abandoned, left behind. I can't stay here another night. Your secret in my heart. Who could it be. Ooh, Can't you see. All along it was me. How can you be so blind. As to see right through me. And Ooh, Solitude,. Still with me is only you. Ooh, Solitude,. I can't stay away from you. Ooh, Solitude,. Forever me and forever you. Ooh, Solitude,. Only you, only true"
say you will,"It's taking you too long to decide. And I don't want to be the one, the one. Crying over wasted time. If you think you're strong enough to let me in. Then come on, stand up and be honest, be honest. I'm tired of feeling so alone. Cause you won't let me understand. I don't wanna pretend, I wanna feel, I want to love. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never, tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Whenever you're around, I can't fight it. You get under my skin the way that I like it. And I can't take anymore. Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone. 'Cause I'm all caught up and I'm losing control. I'm tired of holding on so tight. When you won't let me understand. Now I'm falling apart. I never meant to lose myself. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never, tell the truth. Is this real, is this real. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never, tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?. Like drops of rain against my heart. Cut through like silver. And I want to make you feel that way. And I want to make you feel the way that I do. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never, tell the truth. Is this real?. Say you will or say you won't. Open your heart to me. Now or never, tell the truth. Is this real, is this real?"
must be dreaming,"How can I pretend that I don't see?. What you hide so carelessly?. I saw her bleed; you heard me breathe.. And I froze inside myself and turned away.. I must be dreaming.. (Chorus). We all live.. We all die.. That does not begin to justify you.. It's not what it seems,. Not what you think.. No, I must be dreaming.. It's only in my mind,. Not real life.. No, I must be dreaming.. (Instrument break). Help! I know I've got to tell someone.. Tell them what I know you've done.. I fear you, but spoken fears can come true.. (Chorus). We all live.. We all die.. That does not begin to justify you.. It's not what it seems,. Not what you think.. No, I must be dreaming.. It's only in my mind,. Not real life.. No, I must be dreaming.. (Instrument break). (Chorus). We all live.. We all die.. That does not begin to justify you.. It's not what it seems,. Not what you think.. No, I must be dreaming.. It's only in my mind,. Not real life.. No, I must be dreaming."
lose control,"You don't remember my name. I don't really care. Can we play the game your way?. Can I really lose control?. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control - just once. With all the pretty flowers in the dust. Mary had a lamb. His eyes black as coals. If we play very quiet, my lamb. Mary never has to know. Just once in my life. I think it'd be nice. Just to lose control- just once. If I cut you down to a thing I can use. I fear there will be nothing good left of you"
the change,"Thought that I was strong. I know the words I need to say. Frozen in my place. I let the moment slip away. I've been screaming on the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Oh... Oh... Oh.... Oh... Oh... Oh.... Say it's over. Yes it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me but it's not enough. Never meant to lie. But I'm not the girl you think you know. The more that I am with you. The more that I am all alone. I've been screaming on the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Oh... Oh... Oh.... Oh... Oh... Oh.... Say it's over. Yes it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me but it's not enough. Not that I'm so different. Not that I don't see. The dying light of what we used to be. But how could I forgive you?. You've changed!. And I'm a liar by your side. I'm about to lose my mind. 'Cause I've been screaming on the inside. And I know you feel the pain. Can you hear me?. Can you hear me?. Oh.... You've been dreaming. If you're thinking. That I still belong to you. And I've been dying,. Because I'm lying to myself!. Oh... Oh... Oh.... Oh... Oh... Oh.... Say it's over. Yes it's over. But I need you anyway. Say you love me but it's not enough"
together again,Never thought that I'd be leaving you today. So alone and wondering why I feel this way. So wide the world. Can love remember how to get me home to you. Someday.... We'll be together again. All just a dream in the end. We'll be together again. So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind. Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find. I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide. Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind. We'll be together again. All just a dream in the end
bring me to life,"how can you see into my eyes. like open doors. leading you down into my core. where I've become so numb without a soul. my spirit sleeping somewhere cold. until you find it there and lead it back home. (Wake me up). Wake me up inside. (I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. (Save me). call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up). bid my blood to run. (I can't wake up). before I come undone. (Save me). save me from the nothing I've become. now that I know what I'm without. you can't just leave me. breathe into me and make me real. bring me to life. (Wake me up). Wake me up inside. (I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. (Save me). call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up). bid my blood to run. (I can't wake up). before I come undone. (Save me). save me from the nothing I've become. Bring me to life. (I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside). Bring me to life. frozen inside without your touch. without your love darling. only you are the life among the dead. all this time I can't believe I couldn't see. kept in the dark. but you were there in front of me. I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems. got to open my eyes to everything. without a thought without a voice without a soul. don't let me die here. there must be something more. bring me to life. (Wake me up). Wake me up inside. (I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. (Save me). call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up). bid my blood to run. (I can't wake up). before I come undone. (Save me). save me from the nothing I've become. (Bring me to life). I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside. (Bring me to life)"
erase this,It's too late to change your mind. Even though this fragile world is tearing apart at the seams. You can't wash these sins away. A sinking feeling every day. I'm waking up in someone else's life. Is it so hard for you. Cause it's so hard for me. To believe in what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. Cause I cannot erase this lie. I'm not gonna let this day go by. I'm gonna save this wasted life. And nothing can stand in my way. Not enough to say goodbye. Run until there's nothing left. I'm drowning in the mess that I have made. Is it so hard for you. Cause it's so hard for me. To believe in what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. Cause I cannot erase this lie. Someone hear me. The water's rising around us. There is no other way down. I only have myself to blame. For it all. Is it so hard for you. Cause it's so hard for me. To believe in what we dreamed. Could ever come to life again. If I could just erase my mind. But I cannot erase this lie
wake me up inside bring me to life,"How can you see into my eyes. Like open doors. Leading you down into my core. Where I've been come so numb.. Whithout a soul. My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold. Until you find it there and lead it back home. (Wake me up). Wake me up inside. (I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. (Save me). Call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up). Bid my blood to run. (I can't wake up). Before I come undone. (Save me). Save me from the nothing I've become. Now that I know what I'm without. You can't just leave me. Breathe into me and make me real. Bring me to life. (Wake me up). Wake me up inside. (I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. (Save me). Call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up).

Frozen inside without your touch. Without your love, darling. Only you are the life among the dead. (All of this sight I can't believe). (I couldn't see kept in the dark). (But you were there in front of me). I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems. I've got to open my eyes to everything. (Without a thought, without a voice). (Without a soul don't let me die here). (There must be some thing wrong). Bring me to life. [Wake me up). Wake me up inside. [I can't wake up). Wake me up inside. [Save me). Call my name and save me from the dark. (Wake me up).

tourniquet,"I tried to kill the pain. But only brought more (so much more). I lay dying. And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal. I'm dying (dying). Praying (praying). Bleeding (bleeding). And screaming. Am I too lost to be saved?. Am I too lost?. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. Do you remember me?. Lost for so long. Will you be on the other side?. Will you forget me?. I'm dying (dying). Praying (praying). Bleeding (bleeding). And screaming. Am I too lost to be saved?. Am I too lost?. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. (Return to me salvation). [I want to die]. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My God, my tourniquet. Return to me salvation. My wounds cry for the grave. My soul cries for deliverance. Will I be denied?. Christ -. tourniquet -. my suicide"

exodus,"My black backpack stuffed with broken dreams. Twenty bucks should get me through the week. Never said a word of discontentment. Faught it a thousand times but now. I'm leaving home. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. Two months pass by and it's getting cold. I know I'm not lost I'm just alone. But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now. Waking up is knowing who you really are. Here in the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay where I don't belong. In the shadows. I'm safe, I'm free. I've nowhere else to go. but I cannot stay here. Oh, show me the shadow where true meaning lies. So much more dismay in empty eyes."
imperfection,"The more you try to fight it. The more you try to hide it. The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it. You know you can't deny it. The world's a little more fucked up everyday. I'm gonna save you from it. Together we'll outrun it. Just don't give into the fear. So many things I would've told you If I knew that I was never gonna see you again. I wanna lift you up into the light that you deserve. I wanna take your pain into myself so you won't hurt. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. Cause I would never. Replace your perfect imperfection. The way you look us over. Your counterfeit composure. Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower. The world is on its shoulders. Do you really know the weight of the words you say?. You want a little of it. You just can't let go of it. You've got an ego to feed. Too late to rise above it. Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade. [Pre-Chorus 2:]. I'm gonna lift you up into the light you deserve. I'm gonna take you down to the real world so you can watch it burn. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. Cause I would never. Replace your perfect imperfection. We stand undefined. Can't be drawn with a straight line. This will not be our ending. We are alive, we are alive. Don't you dare surrender. Don't leave me here without you. Cause I would never. Replace your perfect imperfection. Don't you dare surrender. I'm still right beside you. And I would never. Replace your perfect imperfection"
my cartoon network,"I'm Robbie's sister. I guess that's plain to see. When we watch cartoons, cartoons. I'm happy as can be. I think samurai Jack's cool. And Dexter's laboratory. I miss watching Powerpuff. I miss watching TV. Well, living on the tourbus ain’t that bad. But I've feel like I've lost all that I had. Oh, Cartoon network. I miss you so. Oh, Cartoon Network. Where did you go?. Grim &amp; Evil, how I love that little brain. Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?. I hope you learned a lesson here. Treasure what you have. Don't make the mistake I made. The rockstar life is sad. Well living on a tour bus is... pretty bad. And now I'm sure I know. The meaning of my life. The love within my soul. The reason I wake up each day. And it's Cartoon Network. I miss you so. My Cartoon Network. Where did you go?. My Cartoon Network"
whisper,Catch me as I fall. Say you're here and it's all over now. Speaking to the atmosphere. No one's here and I fall into myself. This truth drive me. Into madness. I know I can stop the pain. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep never die). I'm frightened by what I see. But somehow I know. That there's much more to come. Immobilized by my fear. And soon to be. Blinded by tears. I can stop the pain. If I will it all away. Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep never die). Fallen angels at my feet. Whispered voices at my ear. Death before my eyes. Lying next to me I fear. She beckons me. Shall I give in. Upon my end shall I begin. Forsaking all I've fallen for. I rise to meet my end. Don't turn away. (Don't give in to the pain). Don't try to hide. (Though they're screaming your name). Don't close your eyes. (God knows what lies behind them). Don't turn out the light. (Never sleep never die)
what you want,"Do what you what you want, if you have a dream for better. Do what you what you want till you don’t want it anymore. (Remember who you really are). Do what you what you want. Your world’s closing in on you now. (It isn’t over). Stand and face the unknown. (got to remember who you really are). Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection. Hello, hello remember me. I’m everything you can’t control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe we can break through. Do what you what you want. You don’t have to lay your life down. (It isn’t over). Do what you what you want. 'til You find what you’re looking for. (Got to remember who you really are). But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you. Hello, hello remember me. I’m everything you can’t control. Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe. Hello, hello remember me?. I’m everything you can’t control. Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe. There’s still time. Close your eyes. Only love will guide you home. Tear down the walls and free your soul. 'til We crash we’re forever spiraling down, down, down, down. Hello, hello, it’s only me. Infecting everything you love. Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe. Hello, hello remember me. I’m everything you can’t control. Somewhere beyond the pain. here must be a way to learn forgiveness. Hello, hello remember me. I’m everything you can’t control. Somewhere beyond the pain. There must be a way to believe we can break through"
october,"I can't run anymore,. I fall before you,. Here I am,. I have nothing left,. Though I've tried to forget,. You're all that I am,. Take me home,. I'm through fighting it,. Broken,. Lifeless,. I give up,. You're my only strength,. Without you,. I can't go on,. Anymore,. Ever again.. My only hope,. (All the times I've tried). My only peace,. (To walk away from you). My only joy,. My only strength,. (I fall into your abounding grace). My only power,. My only life,. (And love is where I am). My only love.. I can't run anymore,. I give myself to you,. I'm sorry,. I'm sorry,.

farther away,"I took their smiles and I made them mine.. I,I sold my soul just to hide the light.. And now I see what I really am,. A thief a whore, and a liar.. I run to you,. Call out your name,. I see you there, father away.. I'm numb to you - numb and deaf and blind.. You give me all but the reason why.. I reach but I feel only air at night.. Not you, not love, just nothing.. I run to you,. Call out your name,. I see you there, father away.. Try to forget you,. But without you I feel nothing.. Don't leave me here, by myself.. I can't breathe.. I run to you,. Call out your name,. I see you there, father away.. I run to you,. Call out your name,. I see you there, father away,. Farther away,. Father away,. Father away,. Father away,. Father away."
my immortal,I'm so tired of being here. suppressed by all my childish fears. and if you have to leave. I wish that you would just leave. 'cause your presence still lingers here. and it won't leave me alone. these wounds won't seem to heal. this pain is just too real. there's just too much that time cannot erase. when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. and I've held your hand through all of these years. but you still have. all of me. you used to captivate me. by your resonating light. but now I'm bound by the life you left behind. your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. these wounds won't seem to heal. this pain is just too real. there's just too much that time cannot erase. when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. and I've held your hand through all of these years. but you still have. all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. and though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears. when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. and I've held your hand through all of these years. but you still have. all of me

lost in paradise,"I’ve been believing in something so distant, as if I was human. And I’ve been denying this feeling of hopelessness, in me, in me. All the promises I made, just to let you down. You believed in me, but I’m broken. I have nothing left and all I feel is this cruel wanting. We’ve been falling for all this time. And now I’m lost in paradise. As much as I’d like the past not to exist, it still does. And as much as I’d like to feel like I belong here. I’m just as scared as you. I have nothing left and all I feel is this cruel wanting. We’ve been falling for all this time. And now I’m lost in paradise. Run away, run away. One day we won’t feel this pain anymore. Take it all away, shadows of you. 'Cause they won’t let me go. Until I have nothing left and all I feel is this cruel wanting. We’ve been falling for all this time. And now I’m lost in paradise. Alone, and lost in paradise"
cloud nine,"If you want to live, let live.. If you want to go, let go.. I'm not afraid to dream, to sleep, sleep forever.. I don't need to touch the sky.. I just want to feel that high,. And you refuse to lift me.. Guess it wasn't real after all.. Guess it wasn't real all along.. If I fall and all is lost,. It's where I belong.. If you want to live, let live.. If you want to go, let go.. I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender.. Guess it wasn't real after all.. Guess it wasn't real all along.. If I fall and all is lost,. No light to lead the way,. Remember that all alone is where I belong.. In a dream,. Will you give your love to me?. Beg my broken heart to beat,. Save my life, change my mind.. If I fall and all is lost.. No light to lead the way.. Remember that all alone is where I belong."
the end,I found a grave. Brushed off the face. Felt your light and. I remember why I know this place. I found a bird. Closing her eyes. One last time. And I wonder if she dreamed like me. Well as much as it hurts. I did want to fall to feel. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart ‘til it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. I’m not afraid. I push through the pain. And I’m on fire?. I remember how to breathe again. As much as it hurts. I did want to fall to feel. So go on and break your wings. Follow your heart ‘til it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Why must we fall apart. To understand how to fly. I will find a way. Even without wings. Follow your heart ‘til it bleeds. As we run towards the end of the dream. Follow your heart ‘til it bleeds. And we’ve gone to the end of the dream

my heart is broken,"I pulled away to face the pain. I close my eyes and drift away. Over the fear that I will never find a way to heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Torn away from you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us from sorrow's hold. (Over my heart). I can't go on living this way. But I can't go back the way I came. Chained to this fear that I will never find a way to heal my soul. And I will wander till the end of time. Half alive without you. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel. Deliver us. Change. Open your eyes to the light. I denied it all so long, oh so long. Say goodbye. Goodbye. My heart is broken. Release me, I can't hold on. Deliver us. My heart is broken. Sweet sleep, my dark angel.

swimming home,Way down. I've been way down. Underneath this skin. Waiting to hear my name again. I'm sorry. Nothing can hold me. I adore you still. If I hear them calling. And nothing can hold me.

Nothing can hold me. I adore you still. But I hear them calling. I was looking to the sky. When I knew I'd be swimming home. And I cannot betray my kind. They are here - it's my time. I'm sorry. Nothing can hold me. (Do you really want me?). I adore you still. But I hear them calling (calling). And nothing can hold me

all that im living for,All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. I can feel the night beginning. Separate me from the living. Understanding me. After all I've seen. Piecing every thought together. Find the words to make me better. If I only knew how to pull myself apart. All that I'm living for. All that I'm dying for. All that I can't ignore alone at night. All that I'm wanted for. Although I wanted more. Lock the last open door- my ghosts are gaining on me. I believe that dreams are sacred. Take my darkest fears and play them. Like a lullaby. Like a reason why. Like a play of my obsessions. Make me understand the lesson. So I'll find myself. So I wont be lost again.

where will you go ep version,"You're too important for anyone.. There's something wrong with everything you see.. But I, I know who you really are.. You're the one who cries when you're alone.. Where will you go with no one left to save you from yourself?. You can't escape, you don't want to escape.. However did you manage to push away. every living thing you come across?. So afraid that anyone will hate you.. You pretend you hate them first.. And where will you go?. With no one left to save you from yourself.. You can't escape the truth.. I realize you're afraid.. But you can't refrain from everything.. You can't escape,. You can't escape.. I'm so sick of speaking words that no one understands.. Is it clear enough that you can't live your whole life all alone?. I can hear you when you whisper, but you can't even hear me screaming.. And where will you go?.

the last song im wasting on you,"Sparkling grey. Through my own veins. Any more than a whisper. Any sudden movement of my heart. And I know, I know I'll have to watch them pass away. Just get through this day. Give up your way, you could be anything,. Give up my way,. And lose myself,. Not today. That's too much guilt to pay. Sickened in the sun. You dare tell me you love me. But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die. Honey you know, you know I'd never hurt you that way. You're just so pretty in your pain. Give up my way, and I could be anything. I'll make my own way. Without your senseless hate...hate...hate...hate. So run, run, run. And hate me, if it feels good. I can't hear your screams anymore. You lied to me. But I'm older now. And I'm not buying baby. Demanding my response. Don't bother breaking the door down. I found my way out. And you'll never hurt me again"
even in death,"Give me a reason to believe that you're gone. I see your shadow so I know they're all wrong. Moonlight on the soft brown earth. It leads me to where you lay. They took you away from me but now I'm taking you home. I will stay forever here with you, my love. The softly spoken words you gave me. Even in death our love goes on. Some say I'm crazy for my love, oh my love. But no bonds can hold me from your side, oh my love. They don't know you can't leave me. They don't hear you singing to me.

you,"The words have been drained from this pencil. Sweet words that I want to give you. And I can't sleep. I need to tell you. Goodnight. When we're together, I feel perfect. When I'm pulled away from you, I fall apart. All you say is sacred to me. Your eyes are so blue. I can't look away. As we lay in the stillness. You whisper to me. Amy, marry me. Promise you'll stay with me. Oh you don't have to ask me. You know you're all that I live for. You know I'd die just to hold you. Stay with you. Somehow I'll show you. That you are my night sky. I've always been right behind you. Now I'll always be right beside you. So many nights I cried myself to sleep. Now that you love me, I love myself. I never thought I would say this. I never thought there'd be. You"
away from me,"I hold my breath. as this life starts to take its toll. I hide behind a smile. as this perfect plan unfolds. But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to. Lost all faith in the things. I have achieved. And I. I've woken now to find myself. In the shadows of all I have created. I'm longing to be lost in you. (away from this place I have made). Won't you take me away from me. Crawling through this world as disease flows. through my veins. I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed. I can't go on like this. I loathe all I've become. I've woken now to find myself. In the shadows of all I have created. I'm longing to be lost in you. (away from this place I have made). Won't you take me away from me. Lost in a dying world. I reach for something more. I have grown so weary. of this lie I live. I've woken now to find myself. In the shadows of all I have created. I'm longing to be lost in you. (away from this place I have made). Won't you take me away from me"
good enough,"Under your spell again. I can't say no to you. Crave my heart and its bleeding in your hand. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly. Now I can't let go of this dream. I can't breathe but I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough for you. Drink up sweet decadence. I can't say no to you. And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind. I can't say no to you. Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely. Now I can't let go of this dream. Can't believe that I feel. Good enough. I feel good enough. It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good. And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall. Pour real life down on me. Cause I can't hold on to anything this good. Enough. Am I good enough. For you to love me too?. So take care what you ask of me. Cause I can't say no"
sick,"Embrace the silence. Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Taken all that you wanted. Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel. Hold on, little girl. Cause the end is soon to come. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, Sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Oceans between us. And there's nothing that can change the way I feel. I can still taste the poison. Every fall, every breath are ways to heal. Hold on, little girl. The end is soon to come. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, Sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes. Someday you'll know the feeling. Someday I will break through. And nothing you tell yourself. Will save us from the truth. Screaming out. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. We will not follow. Sick of it all, Sick of it all. They don't understand how. Sick we are, Sick we are. Of this bottomless pit of lies. Behind closed eyes"
the other side,Make me whole again. Open your eyes. Taunted by the shadows. Of your lie. Cold and far away. Like you're not even mine. Undo everything. And take me. Higher. Never believing what they say. Cause I'm. Counting the days. To meet you on the other side. I will always be. Waiting. Until the day that I see you. On the other side. Come and take me home. I'm not giving in. I want you back. Holding together by the shards of our past. Stole my heart away. I can't let you go. Break these chains. And let me fly to you. High above the world below. Over and over in my mind. Counting the days. To meet you on the other side. I will always be. Waiting. Until the day that I see you. On the other side. Come and take me home. I am so lost without my place. Inside your heart. I won't survive. I need to know you hear me. Awaken and release my love. Counting the days. To meet you on the other side. I will always be. Waiting. Until the day. That I see you on the other side. Come and take me. Counting the days. To meet you on the other side. I will always be. Waiting. Until the day that I see you. On the other side. Come and take me home
weight of the world,"Feels like the weight of the world. Like God in heaven gave me a turn. Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you. Still in the dark, can you fix me?. Freefall, freefall, all through life. If you love me, then let go of me. I wont be held down by who I used to be. She's nothing to me. Feels like the weight of the world. Like all my screaming has gone unheard. And oh I know you don't believe in me. Safe in the dark, how can you see?. Freefall, freefall, all through life. If you love me, then let go of me. I wont be held down by who I used to be"

imaginary,"Paper flowers, paper flowers.... I linger in the doorway. Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name. Let me stay. Where the wind will whisper to me. Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Don't say I'm out of touch. With this rampant chaos - your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge. The nightmare i built my own world to escape. In my field of paper flowers. And candy clouds of lullaby. I lie inside myself for hours. And watch my purple sky fly over me. Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming. Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights. Oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming. The goddess of imaginary light. Paper flowers, paper flowers"

breathe no more,"I've been looking in the mirror for so long.. That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side.. Oh the little pieces falling, shatter.. Shards of me,. Too sharp to put back together.. Too small to matter,. But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces.. If I try to touch her,. And I bleed,. I bleed,. And I breathe,. I breathe no more.. Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well.. Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child.. Lie to me,. Convince me that I've been sick forever.. And all of this,. Will make sense when I get better.. I know the difference,. Between myself and my reflection.. I just can't help but to wonder,. Which of us do you love.. So I bleed,. I bleed,. And I breathe,. I breathe now.... Bleed,. I bleed,. And I breathe,. I breathe,. I breathe-. I breathe no more."
call me when youre sober,Don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. You want me. Come find me. Make up your mind. Should I let you fall?. Lose it all?. So maybe you can remember yourself. Can't keep believing. We're only deceiving ourselves. And I'm sick of the lie. And you're too late. Don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. You want me. Come find me. Make up your mind. Couldn't take the blame. Sick with shame. Must be exhausting to lose your own game. Selfishly hated. No wonder you're jaded. You can't play the victim this time. And you're too late. So don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. You want me. Come find me. Make up your mind. You never call me when you're sober. You only want it cause it's over. It's over. How could I have burned paradise?. How could I - you were never mine. So don't cry to me. If you loved me. You would be here with me. Don't lie to me. Just get your things. I've made up your mind
hello,"Playground school bell rings again.. Rain clouds come to play again.. Has no one told you she's not breathing?. Hello, i'm your mind giving you someone to talk to, hello.. If i smile and don't believe soon I know i'll wake from this dream.. Don't try to fix me, i'm not broken.. Hello, i'm the lie living for you so you can hide. Don't cry.. Suddenly i know i'm not sleeping.. Hello, i'm still here.. All that's left of yesterday"
fields of innocence,I still remember the world. From the eyes of a child. Slowly those feelings. Were clouded by what I know now. Where has my heart gone. An uneven trade for the real world. oh I.... I want to go back to. Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all. I still remember the sun. Always warm on my back. Somehow it seems colder now. Where has my heart gone. Trapped in the eyes of a stranger. oh why.... I want to go back to. Believing in everything. Where has my heart gone. An uneven trade for the real world. oh I.... I want to go back to. Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all. Where has my heart gone. Trapped in the eyes of a stranger. oh why.... I want to go back to. Believing in everything
give unto me,I've been watching you from a distance. The distance sees through your disguise. All I want from you is your hurting. I want to heal you. I want to save you from the dark. Give unto me your troubles. I'll endure your suffering. Place onto me your burden. I'll drink your deadly poison. Why should I care if they hurt you?. Somehow it matters more to me. Than if I were hurting myself. Save you (save you). I'll save you. Fear not the flame of my love's candle. Let it be the sun in your world of darkness. Give unto me all that frightens you. I'll have your nightmares for you. If you sleep soundly. Give unto me your troubles. I'll endure your suffering. Place onto me your burden. I'll drink your deadly poison. Fear not the flame of my love's candle. Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
sweet sacrifice,"It's true, we're all a little insane. But it's so clear. Now that I'm unchained. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds but its taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me - don't deny. Sweet sacrifice. One day I'm gonna forget your name. And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain. Fear is only in our minds. Taking over all the time. Fear is only in our minds but its taking over all the time. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. And oh, you love to hate me, don't you, honey?. I'm your sacrifice.. I dream in darkness. I sleep to die. Erase the silence. Erase my life. Our burning ashes. Blacken the day. A world of nothingness. Blow me away. Do you wonder why you hate?. Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?. You poor sweet innocent thing. Dry your eyes and testify. You know you live to break me - don't deny. Sweet sacrifice"
anywhere,"Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me. And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free. I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you. And at sweet night, you are my own. Take my hand. We're leaving here tonight. There's no need to tell anyone. They'd only hold us down. So by the morning light. We'll be half way to anywhere. Where love is more than just your name. I have dreamt of a place for you and I. No one knows who we are there. All I want is to give my life only to you. I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore. Let's run away, I'll take you there. We're leaving here tonight. There's no need to tell anyone. They'd only hold us down. So by the morning light. We'll be half way to anywhere. Where love is more than just your name. Forget this life. Come with me. Don't look back you're safe now. Unlock your heart. Drop your guard. No one's left to stop you. Forget this life. Come with me. Don't look back you're safe now. Unlock your heart.

lacrymosa,"Out on your own. Cold and alone again. Can this be what you really wanted, baby?. Blame it on me. Set your guilt free. Nothing can hold you back now. Now that you're gone. I feel like myself again. Grieving the things I can't repair and willing.... To let you blame it on me. And set your guilt free. I don't want to hold you back now love. I can't change who I am. Not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me. And in this short life, there's no time to waste on giving up. My love wasn't enough. And you can blame it on me. Just set your guilt free, honey. I don't want to hold you back now love"
secret door,"Turn out the lights. Feed the fire till my soul breathes free. My heart is high as the waves above me. Don't need to understand. Too lost to lose. Don't fight my tears, cuz they feel so good. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door. Look past the end. It's a dream, as it's always been. All life lives on if we've ever loved it. And I, I will remember how to fly. Unlock the heavens in my mind. Follow my love back through the same secret door"
angel of mine,"You are everything I need to see. Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me. Laugh and come and look into me. Drips of moonlight washing over me. Can I show you what you are for me. Angel of mine, let me I thank you. You have saved me time and time again. Angel, I must confess. It's you that always gives me strength. And I don't know where I'd be without you. After all these years, one thing is true. Constant force within my heart is you. You touch me, I feel I'm moving into you. I treasure every day I spend with you. All the things I am come down to you. Angel of mine. Let me thank you. You have saved me time and time again. Angel, I must confess. It's you that always gives me strength. And I don't know where I'd be without you. Back in the arms of my angel. Back to the peace that I so love. Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest. Giving you a gift that you remind me"
i believe in you,"You don't remember me. But I remember you. I lie awake. And try so hard to not think of you. But who can decide what they dream. And dream I do. I believe in you. I`ll give up everything. Just to find you. I have to be with you. To live, to breathe. You`re taking over me. Have you forgotten. All I know. And all we had. You saw me mourning my love for you. And touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I believe in you. I'll give up everything. Just to find you. I have to be with you. To live, to breathe. You're taking over me. I look in the mirror and see your face. If I look deep enough. So many things inside that are. Just like you are taking over. I believe in you. I'll give up everything. Just to find you. I have to be with you. To live, to breathe. You're taking over me. I believe in you. I'll give up everything for you. Just to find you. I have to be with you. To live to breathe. You're taking over me. You're taking over me. You're taking over me"
never go back,"Everything is so dark. And I know there's something wrong. But I, can't turn the light on. In that split second change. When you knew we couldn't hold on. I realized I lived to love you. Save yourself. Don't look back. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I remember. I won't give up on you. I can feel you in my heart, just show me the way. I don't belong here. Alone. I can still see your face. Where it's burned into my mind. I die every time. I close my eyes, you're always there. Save yourself. Don't look back. Tearing us apart until it's all gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back home. All across the ocean. We are calling, calling. Are you there. Nothing left for me till I find you because it's. All gone. The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves. But I'm the one who's drowning. Without your love. I am lost and I can never go back. I can never go back home"
zero,"My reflection, dirty mirror. There's no connection to myself. I'm your lover, I'm your zero. I'm in the face of your dreams of glass. So save your prayers. For when we're really gonna need'em. Throw out your cares and fly. Wanna go for a ride?. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. Cause she's the one for me. Emptiness is loneliness,. and loneliness is cleanliness. And cleanliness is godliness,. And god is empty just like me. You never believe. Intoxicated with the madness. I'm in love with my sadness. Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms. The fasion victims chew their charcoal teeth. I never let on. That I was on a sinking ship. I never let on that I was down. You blame yourself. For what you can't ignore. You blame yourself for wanting more. She's the one for me. She's all I really need. She's the one for me. She's my one and only"
your star,"I can't see your star. I can't see your star. Though I patiently waited, bedside. For the death of today. I can't see your star. The mechanical lights of Lisbon. Frightened it away. And I'm alone now. Me and all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts, in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. I can't see your star. I can't see your star. How can the darkness feel so wrong?. And I'm alone now. Me and all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts, in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. So far away. It's growing colder without your love. Why can't you feel me calling your name?. Can't break the silence. It's breaking me. All my fears turn to rage. And I'm alone now. Me and all I stood for. We're wandering now. All in parts, in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out. Nothing worth fighting for. We're wandering now. All in parts, in pieces, swim lonely. Find your own way out"
lies,"Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear. Sealed with lies through so many tears. Lost from within, pursuing the end. I fight for the chance to be lied to again. You will never be strong enough. You will never be good enough. You were never conceived in love. You will not rise above. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. But through my tears breaks a blinding light. Birthing a dawn to this endless night. Arms outstretched, awaiting me. An open embrace upon a bleeding tree. Rest in me and I'll comfort you. I have lived and I died for you. Abide in me and I vow to you. I will never forsake you. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me. They'll never see. I'll never be. I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger. Burning deep inside of me"
like you,"Stay low. Soft, dark, and dreamless. Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness. I hate me. For breathing without you. I don't want to feel anymore for you. Grieving for you. I'm not grieving for you. Nothing real love can't undo. And though I may have lost my way. All paths lead straight to you. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. Halo. Blinding wall between us. Melt away and leave us alone again. Humming, haunted somewhere out there. I believe our love can see us through in death. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you. You're not alone. No matter what they told you you're not alone. I'll be right beside you forevermore. I long to be like you, sis. Lie cold in the ground like you're dead. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. And as we lay in silent bliss. I know you remember me. I long to be like you. Lie cold in the ground like you. There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you. I'm coming for you"
where will you go,"You're too important for anyone. You play the role of all you long to be. But I, I know who you really are. You're the one who cries when you're alone. But where will you go. With no one left to save you from yourself. You can't escape. You can't escape. You think that I can't see right through your eyes. Scared to death to face reality. No one seems to hear your hidden cries. You're left to face yourself alone. But where will you go. With no one left to save you from yourself. You can't escape. You can't escape. I realize you're afraid. But you can't abandon everyone. You can't escape. You don't want to escape. I'm so sick. of speaking words that no one understands. Is it clear enough that you can't live. your whole life all alone. I can hear you in a whisper. But you can't even hear me screaming. But where will you go. With no one left to save you from yourself. You can't escape. You can't escape. I realize you're afraid. But you can't reject the whole world. You can't escape. You won't escape. You can't escape. You don't want to escape"
the last day,"I've spent so much time throwing rocks at your window. That I never even knocked on the front door. I walk by statues never even made one chip. But if I could leave a mark on the monument of the heart. I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day. The last day, the last day, the last day. Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves. These days have come and gone. But this time is sweeter than honey"
goodnight,"Goodnight, sleep tight. No more tears. In the morning, I'll be here. And when we say goodnight,. Dry your eyes. Because we said goodnight,. And now goodbye. We said goodnight. And now goodbye"
understanding wash it all away,"You hold the answer deep within your own mind.. Consciously you've forgotten it.. That's the way the human mind works.. Whenever something is too unpleasant,. too shameful for us to entertain we reject it,. we erase it from our memory,. but the imprint is always there.. We wash it all away,. we wish it all away,. we hope it all away,. can't cry it all away.. The pain that grips you. The fear that binds you. Releases life in me. In our mutual shame we hide our eyes. To blind them from the truth. that finds a way to who we are. Please don't be afraid. When the darkness fades away. The dawn will break the silence. screaming at our hearts. My love for you still grows. This I do for you. Before I try to fight the truth. my final time. We're supposed to try to be real.. We feel alone when we're not together,. and that is real.. Can't wash it all away. Can't wish it all away. Can't cry it all away. Can't scratch it all away. Lying beside you. Listening to you breathe. The light that flows inside of you. burns inside of me. Hold and speak to me. Of love without a sound. Tell me you will live through this. and I will die for you. Cast me not away. Say you'll be with me. For I know I cannot bear it all alone. You're not alone, honey, Never. Never.. Can't fight it all away. Can't hope it all away. Can't scream it all away. It just won't fade away. Can't wash it all away. Can't wish it all away can't can't can't. Can't throw it all away. Can't scratch it all away. Can't fight it all away. Can't hope it all away. Can't scream it all away. Oh get it all away. Oh get it all away. But the imprint is always there,. nothing is ever really forgotten. Because I'm dying too,. because I'm dying too,. because I'm dying too,. because I'm dying too,. because I'm dying too"
my last breath,"Hold on to me, love. You know I can't stay long,. All I wanted to say was. I love you and I'm not afraid, aaah. Can you hear me?. Can you feel me in your arms?. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light - it ends here tonight. I'll miss the winter. A world of fragile things. Look for me in the white forest. Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me). I know you hear me. I can taste it in your tears!. Holding my last breath. Safe inside myself. Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light - it ends here tonight. Closing your eyes to disappear. You pray your dreams will leave you here. But still you wake and know the truth. No one's there. Say goodnight. Don't be afraid. Calling me, calling me as you fade to black. (Say goodnight). Holding my last breath. (don't be afraid). Safe inside myself. (calling me, calling me). Are all my thoughts of you. Sweet raptured light it ends here tonight. (Holding my last breath). (Safe inside myself). (Are all my thoughts of you). (Sweet raptured light - it ends here tonight). (Holding my last breath)"
fall into you,"Since you've been gone i've been alone. feeling untied and free. no more crying on the phone. no more slavery. end of the misery i'm breaking free. since you've been gone things have come so clear to me. just wanna shout cause i'm able to breathe. ooooooh, since you've been gone i've been free. since we crashed and fell apart. we've been history. since we trashed this dying love. no more agony, no. end of the misery i'm breaking free. since you've been gone things have come so clear to me. just wanna shout cause i'm able to breathe. ooooooh, since you've been gone i've been free. since you've been gone things have come so clear to me. just wanna shout cause i'm able to breathe. since you've been gone things have come so clear to me. just wanna shout cause i'm able to breathe. ooooooh, since you've been gone i've been free. ooooooh, since you've been gone i've been. ooooooh, i've been free. ooooooh, things have come clear to me. ooooooh, i'm free. . since you've been gone i've been alone. "
forgive me,"Can you forgive me again?. I don't know what I said. But I didn't mean to hurt you. I heard the words come out. I felt like I would die. It hurt so much to hurt you. Then you look at me. You're not shouting anymore. You're silently broken. I'd give anything now. to kill those words for you. Each time I say something I regret I cry. ""I don't want to lose you."". But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah.. 'Cause you were made for me. Somehow I'll make you see. How happy you make me. I can't live this life. Without you by my side. I need you to survive. So stay with me. You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside. that I'm sorry.. And you forgive me again. You're my one true friend. And I never meant to hurt you"
4th of july,Shower in the dark day. Clean sparks driving down. Cool in the waterway. Where the baptized drown. Naked in the cold sun. Breathing life like fire. Thought I was the only one. But that was just a lie. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Pale in the flare light. The scared light cracks &amp; disappears. And leads the scorched ones here. And everywhere no one cares. The fire is spreading. And no one wants to speak about it. Down in the hole. Jesus tries to crack a smile. Beneath another shovel load. And I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July. Now I'm in control. Now I'm in the fall out. Once asleep but now I stand. And I still remember. Your sweet everything. Light a Roman candle. And hold it in your hand. Cause I heard it in the wind. And I saw it in the sky. And I thought it was the end. And I thought it was the 4th of July
the only one,"When they all come crashing down- midflight. you know you're not the only one. when they're so alone they find a back door out of life. you know you're not the only one. We're all grieving. lost and bleeding. All our lives. we've been waiting. for someone to call our leader. all your lies. I'm not believing. heaven shine a light down on me. So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized. you know you're not the only one. never understood this life. and you're right I don't deserve. but you know I'm not the only one. We're all grieving. lost and bleeding. All our lives. we've been waiting. for someone to call our leader. all your lies. I'm not believing. heaven shine a light down on me. Don't look down. don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you. don't look down, you'll fall down,. you'll become their sacrifice. right or wrong. can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you. if I can't feel, I'm not mine,. I'm not real. All our lives. we've been waiting. for someone to call our leader. all your lies. I'm not believing. heaven shine a light down on me"
before the dawn,"Meet me after dark again. and I'll hold you. I am nothing more than to see you there. And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away. We'll be lost before the dawn. If only night can hold you. where i can see you, my love. Then let me never ever wake again. And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away. We'll be lost before the dawn. somehow i know that we cant wake again. from this dream. it's not real, but it's ours. Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away. We'll be lost before the dawn. Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away. We'll be lost before the dawn"
