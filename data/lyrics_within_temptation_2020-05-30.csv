a dangerous mind,"Cause something is not right. I follow the signs. I'm close to the fire. I fear that soon you'll reveal. Your dangerous mind. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. I fear your smile and the promise inside. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside. I'm searching for answers. Not questioned before. The curse of awareness. There's no peace of mind. As your true colours show. A dangerous sign. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. I see the truth that you've buried inside. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. There is no mercy, just anger I find. I just have to know, while I still have time. Do I have to run, or hide away from you?. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. I see the truth that you've buried inside. It's in your eyes, what's on your mind. There is no mercy, just anger I find"
a demons fate,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. You'll burn this time, seeing the violence. It's feeding my mind, no one is saving you. How can you find a heaven in this hell. Leave it behind, hearing your silence. It screams our goodbye. Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye. Love is gone to waste. Angels have faith. I don't want to be a part of his sin. I don't want to get lost in his world. I'm not playing this game. When the shadows remain in the light of day. On the wings of darkness, he'll retaliate. He'll be falling from grace. Till the end of all his days. From the ashes of hate, it's a cruel demon's fate. On the wings of darkness, he's returned to stay. There will be no escape, 'cause he's fallen far from grace. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What have you done, is this what you wanted. What have you become, his soul's not forsaken. You're walking alone, from heaven into hell. Now that you know, your way in this madness. Your powers are gone, your chains have been broken. You've suffered so long, you will never change. Angels have faith. I don't want to be a part of his sin. I don't want to get lost in his world. I'm not playing this game. When the shadows remain in the light of day. On the wings of darkness, he'll retaliate. He'll be falling from grace. Till the end of all his days. From the ashes of hate, it's a cruel demon's fate. On the wings of darkness, he's returned to stay. There will be no escape, 'cause he's fallen far from grace. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Angels have faith. I don't want to be a part of his sin. I don't want to get lost in his world. I'm not playing this game. When the shadows remain in the light of day. On the wings of darkness, he'll retaliate. He'll be falling from grace. Till the end of all his days. From the ashes of hate, it's a cruel demon's fate. On the wings of darkness, he's returned to stay. There will be no escape, 'cause he's fallen far from grace"
all i need,"I'm dying to catch my breath. Oh why don't I ever learn?. I've lost all my trust,. though I've surely tried to turn it around. Can you still see the heart of me?. All my agony fades away. when you hold me in your embrace. Don't tear me down for all I need. Make my heart a better place. Give me something I can believe. Don't tear me down. You've opened the door now, don't let it close. I'm here on the edge again. I wish I could let it go. I know that I'm only one step away. from turning it around. Can you still see the heart of me?. All my agony fades away. when you hold me in your embrace. Don't tear me down for all I need. Make my heart a better place. Give me something I can believe. Don't tear it down, what's left of me. Make my heart a better place. I tried many times but nothing was real. Make it fade away, don't break me down. I want to believe that this is for real. Save me from my fear. Don't tear me down. Don't tear me down for all I need. Make my heart a better place. Don't tear me down for all I need. Make my heart a better place. Give me something I can believe. Don't tear it down, what's left of me. Make my heart a better place. Make my heart a better place"
angels,"Sparkling angel I believed. You were my saviour in my time of need. Blinded by faith I couldn't hear. All the whispers, the warnings so clear. I see the angels. I'll lead them to your door. There's no escape now. No mercy no more. No remorse cause I still remember. The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart. Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams. I wished they'd turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Sparkling angel, I couldn't see. Your dark intensions, your feelings for me. Fallen angel, tell me why?. What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?. I see the angels. I'll lead them to your door. There's no escape now. No mercy no more. No remorse cause I still remember. The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart. Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams. I wished they'd turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Could have been forever. Now we have reached the end. This world may have failed you. It doesn't give you reason why. You could have chosen a different path in life. The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart. Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams. I wished they'd turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Could have been forever. Now we have reached the end"
another day,"I know you are going away. I take my love into another day. In my thoughts you're with me. I fell in love with your ways. I know you are going away. Lead my heart into a daze. I know you are going away. Leaves a void in my heart and soul. I know you are going away. I take my love into another day. In my thoughts you're with me. I fell in love with your ways. I know you are going away. Leads my heart into a daze. I know you are going away. Leaves a void in my heart and soul. Wherever you are. Whatever you do. I feel the walls surrounding you. Wherever you are. Whatever you do. I know you're independent. But I'm trying to get through to you. Wherever you are. Wherever you are. Don't you know, it depends on you. I know you are going away. Lead my heart into a daze. I know you are going away. Leave a void in my heart and soul"
aquarius,"I hear your whispers. Break the silence and it calms me down. Your taste on my lips. Your salty kisses. They say I'm seeking out the danger. That one day you won't let me go. (I'll drown, you'll take me down). I need you Aquarius. Enchanted I will have to stay. I feel you Aquarius. Cause you the sea set me free. You call to me Aquarius. (You call to me, you set me free). I relinquish to your powers. From your grasp, I just can't hide. I missed the danger I had to conquer. You made me feel alive. They say I have to be aware. That one day you won't let me go. (I'll drown, you'll take me down). I need you Aquarius. Enchanted I will have to stay. I feel you Aquarius. Cause you the sea set me free. You call to me Aquarius. I long for you Aquarius. I need to be with you again. I fear you Aquarius. My destiny till the end. I need you Aquarius. Enchanted I will have to stay. I feel you Aquarius. Cause you the sea set me free"
bittersweet,"If I tell you. Will you listen?. Will you stay?. Will you be here forever?. Never go away?. Never thought things would change,. Hold me tight. Please don't say again. That you have to go. A bitter thought. I had it all. But I just let it go. Hold your silence. It's so violent. Since you're gone. All my thoughts are with you forever. Until the day we'll be back together. I will be waiting for you. If I had told you. You would have listened. You had stayed. You would be here forever. Never went away. It would never have been the same. All our time. Would have been in vain. Cause you had to go. The sweetest thought. I had it all. Cause I did let you go. All our moments. Keep me warm. When you're gone. All my thoughts are with you forever. Until the day we'll be back together. I will be waiting for you"
blue eyes,"Blue eyes wide to the world. Full of dreams and with fascination. Too soon She saw that their hands were chained. And pulled without any freedom. It's always the same. I fear no way out. I cannot break it. I can't take it no more. It's burning me up inside. Lost all my tears, can't cry. No reason, no meaning. Just hatred. No matter how hard I try. You're fearing a beast inside. It's growing, it's waiting. Just to hurt you. This heart was hurt by the lights and. I see a world that tries to deny us. Now everything that I love had died. Our hands being Shattered to pieces"
caged,These are the darkest clouds. They have surrounded me. Now I find my self alone caught in a cage. There's no flower to be found in here. Not withering. Or pale to me. Everyone with a friendly face. Seems to hide some secret inside. He told me he loved me. While he laughed in my face. He just led me astray. He took my virtue. I feel so cold inside. Sorrow has frozen my mind. My heart is covered. With thoughts entangled. How could it ever have felt so real?. Is there a place more lonely than I feel within?. Could I have seen?. Could I have known?. I just took it as the truth. Everyone with a friendly face. Seems to hide some secret inside. He told me he loved me. While he laughed in my face. He just led me astray. He took my virtue. I feel so cold inside. Sorrow has frozen my mind. Always there to remind me. He keeps me from believing. That someone might be there. Who'll free me and never ever leave me. He told me he loved me. While he laughed in my face. He just led me astray. He took my virtue. I feel so cold inside. Sorrow has frozen my mind
candles,"Take away. These hands of darkness. Reaching for my soul. Now, the cold wind. Blows out my candles. Feeling. Only fear. Without any hope. A thousand dark moons. A thousand winters long. A million fallen stars. The candle burns in the womb. We try not to forget. They live through us. Slowly they die away at every candle's end. A thousand dark moons. A thousand winters long. A million fallen stars. The candle burns in the womb. We try not to forget. They live through us. Slowly they die away at every candle's end"
dark wings,"Why was I one of the chosen ones?. Until the fight I could not see. The magic and the strength of my power. It was beyond my wildest dreams. Dark wings they are descending. See shadows gathering around. One by one they are falling. Every time they try to strike us down. Don't you die on me. You haven't made your peace. Live life, breathe, breathe. Don't you die on me. You haven't made your peace. Live life, breathe, breathe. As they took your soul away. The night turned into the day. Blinded by your rays of life. Give us the strength we needed"
deceiver of fools,"He feeds on fear. He feeds on pain. He rules again. If for all he hate. He will guide. That faith again. Our lights in the darkness. Is too small to see. There's always a sparkle of hope. If you just believe. ------------------. He told the tale so many times. About the dream not meant to be. In a world of the free. He plays with your mind. As faith for the future faded fast. He grows strong with their displeasure. It sets him free. Deceiver of hearts. Deceiver of fools. He rules with fear. Deceiver of hopes. Deceiver of fools. He rules again. He feeds on fear. Poisons the truth. To gain their faith. To lead the way. To a world of decay. He rules your heart. He will sell your soul to the grave. Without a hesitation to make. He belongs to the dark. Deceiver of hearts. Deceiver of fools. He rules with fear. Deceiver of hopes. Deceiver of fools. He rules again. Please awake. And see the truth. He can only be. If you believe what he tells you. Remember who you are. What you stand for. And there will always be a way. Deceiver of hearts. Deceiver of fools. He rules with fear. Deceiver of hopes. Deceiver of fools. He rules again. In my heart there is a place. In my heart there is a trace. Of a small fire burning. A sheltering ray shines through this night. Although it's small, it's bright. But darkness is lurking. He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold. Oh fear him. Deceiver of hearts. Deceiver of fools. He rules with fear. Deceiver of hopes. Deceiver of fools. Shall he rule again?"
deep within,"Is there a place deep within. A place where you hide your darkest sins. There's a strange kind of ambiance. It's surrounding you. As a songstress lure me. Towards the truth. Candles die down as you leave the room. In my heart you leave no gloom. As you lure me I know the truth. You're a leprechaun, I see you through. Is there a place deep within. A place where you hide your darkest sins. There's a strange kind of ambiance. It's surrounding you. As a songstress lure me. Towards the truth"
destroyed,I did my best to please you. But my best was never good enough. Somehow you're only able to see. All I am not. Did you ever look behind. Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find. I have failed you. But you have failed me too. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. Do you ever wonder if it's justified. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. In your life why didn't you ever try. I close my eyes as I walk the thin line. Between love and hate. For the person with the same blood in his veins. You show no regrets. About all the things you did or said. I have failed you. But believe me. You failed me too. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. Do you ever wonder if it's justified. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. In your life why didn't you ever try. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. Do you ever wonder if it's justified. It's so easy to destroy and condemn. The ones you do not understand. Do you ever wonder if it's justified
edge of the world,"Can I swallow the soil,. Make it all beautiful?. Can I carry it, carry it, carry it now?. The truth can't bare the sunlight.. You're afraid for the day it does.. Hell when I told you so,. I got burn, burn, burned again.. Heaven forbid that my heart is forsaken.. Hope in the end truth prevails.. I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world.. Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try.. I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world.. Need to find my way home, home.. He earns fire as a god. But I believed in your heart. And I'm leaving you, leaving you, leaving you now.. The truth can't bare the sunlight.. And don't pretend to be my guide.. Heard you said you'd change it over. But I got burn, burn, burned instead.. Heaven can wait cause my soul is forsaken.. Hope in the end truth prevails.. [2x]. I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world.. Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try.. I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world.. Need to find my way home, home.. Just to fall out, no more rain.. Once upon a time."
enter,"Welcome to my home. The gates of time have opened. Now, it's chains are broken. An ancient force unleased again. As I enter the portal. I feel the enchantment. It takes me away, away from here. Come near me. Enter my private chambers. I want to feel the warmth on my face. Light-in darkness. Lift me up from here. Give me you wings. To flee from my ivory tower. As I enter the portal. I feel the enchantment. The stars above are lying at my feet. Come near me. Enter my private chambers. I want to feel the warmth on my face. Light-in darkness. Lift me up from here. Give me you wings. To flee from my ivory tower"
faster,I can't see. 'Cause it's burning deep inside. Like gasoline. All fire running wild. No more fear. 'Cause I'm getting closer now. So unreal. But I like it anyhow. And I go faster and faster and faster and faster. And faster and faster and faster. And I can't live in a fairytale of lies. And I can't hide from the feeling 'cause it is right. And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life. I can't live in a fairytale of lies. I can feel. That you mesmerized my heart. I feel so free. I'm in love I'm breaking out.

A fairytale of lies
final destination,"I escaped my final moment. But it's turning back at me. On every corner I can feel it waiting. Just a moment, no awareness. I could easily slip away. And then I'll be gone forever. I'm searching,. I'm fighting for a way to get through. To turn it away. It's waiting, always trying. I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating. Tell me what's the reason. Is it all inside my head. Can't take it no more!. All around me I see danger. And it's closing in on me. Every second I can hear it breathing. I can't stand the fear inside me. Cause it's leading me astray. And it will be my ending. I'm searching. I'm fighting for a way to get through. To turn it away. It's waiting, always trying. I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating. Tell me what's the reason. Is it all inside my head. Can't take it no more!. But now I'll face what's coming my way.. And I will let my fear fade away. Whatever may be, I'll have to find out.. It's waiting, always trying.. I feel the hands of fate. They're suffocating.. Tell me what's the reason?. Is it all inside my head?. Can't take it no more"
fire and ice,"Every word you're saying is a lie. Run away my dear. But every sign will say. Your heart is dead. Bury all the memories. Cover them with dirt. Where's the love we once had. Our destiny's unsure. Why can't you see what we had. Let the fire burn the ice. Where's the love we once had. Is it all a lie. And I still wonder. Why heaven has died. The skies are all falling. I'm breathing but why. In silence I hold on. To you and I. Closer to insantiy. Buries me alive. Where's the life we once had. It cannot be denied. Why can't you see what we had. Let the fire burn the ice. Where's the love we once had. Is it all a lie. And I still wonder. Why heaven has died. The skies are all falling. I'm breathing but why. In silence I hold on. To you and I. You run away, you hide away. To the other side of the universe. Where you're safe from all that hunts you down. But the world has gone, where you belong. And it feels too late so you're moving on. Can you find your way back home. And I still wonder. Why heaven has died. The skies are all falling. I'm breathing but why. In silence I hold on. To you and I. Every word you're saying is a lie"
forgiven,"Love you so it hurts my soul. Can you forgive me for trying again. Your silence makes me hold my breath. Time has passed you by. Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world. Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own. Here I am left in silence. You gave up the fight. You left me behind. All that's done's forgiven. You'll always be mine. I know deep inside. All that's done's forgiven. I watched the clouds drifting away. Still the sun can't warm my face. I know it was destined to go wrong. You were looking for the great escape. To chase your demons away. Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world. Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own. Here I am left in silence. You gave up the fight. You left me behind. All that's done's forgiven. You'll always be mine. I know deep inside. All that's done's forgiven. I've been so lost since you've gone. Why not me before you?. Why did fate deceive me?. Everything turned out so wrong. Why did you leave me in silence?. You gave up the fight. You left me behind. All that's done's forgiven. You'll always be mine. I know deep inside. All that's done's forgiven"
forsaken,"Now the day has come. We are forsaken this time. We lived our lives in our paradise. As gods we shaped the world around. No borderlines we'd stay behind. Though balance is something fragile. While we thought we were gaining. We would turn back the tide, it still slips away. Our time has run out, our future has died. There's no more escape. Now the day has come. We are forsaken. There's no time anymore. Life will pass us by. We are forsaken. We're the last of our kind. The sacrifice was much too high. Our greed just made us all go blind. We tried to hide what we feared inside. Today is the end of tomorrow. As the sea started rising. The land that we'd conquered just washed away. Although we all have tried to turn back the tide. It was all in vain. Now the day has come. We are forsaken. There's no time anymore. Life will pass us by. We are forsaken. Only ruins stay behind. Now the day has come. We are forsaken this time. Now the day has come. We are forsaken. There's no time anymore. Now the day has come. The day has come. The day has come"
frozen,"I can't feel my senses. I just feel the cold. All colors seem to fade away. I can't reach my soul. I would stop running. If I knew there was a chance. It tears me apart to sacrifice it all. But I'm forced to let go. Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?. Can't tell the reasons I did it for you. When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you. You say that I'm frozen but what can I do?. I can feel your sorrow. You won't forgive me. But I know you'll be all right. It tears me apart that you will never know. But I have to let go. Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?. Can't tell the reasons I did it for you. When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you. You say that I'm frozen but what can I do?. Everything will slip away. Shattered peaces will remain. When memories fade into emptiness. Only time will tell its tale. If it all has been in vain. I can't feel my senses. I just feel the cold. Frozen.... But what can I do?. Frozen.... Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?. Can't tell the reasons I did it for you. When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you. You say that I'm frozen, frozen..."
gothic christmas,"We're gonna have a gothic christmas. That is what we'll do. We're gonna have a gothic christmas. Hope you'll have one too. Santa's going to wear a black dress. Just for me and you. Santa's going to grunt in latin. And slay a dragon or two. Rudolph, he will change his name. 'Cause Rudolph just sounds pretty lame. Now we'll call him Ragnagord. The evil reindeer overlord. His nose it shall be red no more. It will be blackened to the core. His eyes will glow an evil glow. To guide the chariot through the snow. We want to wish you a gothic christmas. We want to wish you a gothic christmas. We want to wish you a gothic christmas. We want to wish you a gothic christmas. We're gonna have a gothic christmas. That is what we'll do.

grace,"Cold are the bones of thy soldiers. Longing for home, their little paradise. I don't feel remdeption on their side. Fallen from grace, help me rise again. Fallen from grace, help me through. Fallen from grace, help me through. Fallen from grace. Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble. Do you hear these words?. Do you feel the wounds?. I'll never help you through. Cold are thy souls. I feel resentment. They feel betrayed. They hate the cold. I don't feel redemption on their side. Fallen from grace, help me rise again. Fallen from grace, help me through"
hand of sorrow,"The child without a name grew up to be the hand. To watch you, to shield you or kill on demand. The choice he'd made he could not comprehend. His blood a grim secret they had to command. He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life. He prayed for both but was denied. So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed. Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?. So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?. Will all our sins be justified?. The curse of his powers tormented his life. Obeying the crown was a sinister price. His soul was tortured by love and by pain. He surely would flee but the oath made him stay. He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life. He prayed for both but was denied. So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed. Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?. So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?. Will all our sins be justified?. Please forgive me for the sorrow, for leaving you in fear. For the dreams we had to silence, that's all they'll ever be. Still I'll be the hand that serves you. Though you'll not see that it is me. So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed. Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?. So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?. Will all our sins be justified?"
ice queen,"When leaves have fallen. And skies turned into grey. The night keeps on closing in on the day. A nightingale sings his song of farewell. You better hide for her freezing hell. On cold wings she's coming. You better keep moving. For warmth, you'll be longing. Come on just feel it. Don't you see it?. You better believe. When she embraces. Your heart turns to stone. She comes at night when you are all alone. And when she whispers. Your blood shall run cold. You better hide before she finds you. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. Whenever she is raging. She takes a life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak. The sun awakes and melts it away. The world now opens its eyes and sees. The dawning of a new day. On cold wings she's coming. You better keep moving. For warmth, you'll be longing. Come on just feel it. Don't you see it?. You better believe. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world. Whenever she is raging. She takes all life away. Haven't you seen?. Haven't you seen?. The ruins of our world"
in perfect harmony,"At the end of a closing day. A little child was born and raised. Deep in the forest on a hidden place. Mother never saw his face. Ancient spirits of the forest. Made him king of elves and trees. He was the only human being. Who lived in harmony. In perfect harmony. Ancient spirits of the forest. Made him king of elves and trees. He was the only human being. Who lived in harmony. In perfect harmony. The woods protected, fullfilled his needs. Fruit by birds, honey by bees. He found shelter under trees. He grew up in their company. They became his family.

Made him king of elves and trees. He was the only human being. Who lived in harmony. In perfect harmony. A thousand seasons. They passed him by. So many times, have said goodbye. And when the spirits called out his name. To join forever, forever to stay. A forest spirit he became. Ancient spirits of the forest. Made him king of elves and trees. He was the only human being. Who lived in harmony. In perfect harmony. Ancient spirits of the forest. Made him king of elves and trees. He was the only human being. Who lived in harmony. In perfect harmony. In perfect harmony.

in the middle of the night,"Ooooh, ooooh. Ooooh, ooooh. Ooooh, ooooh. Ooooh, ooooh. I've been walking this road of desire. I've been begging for blood on the wall. I don't care if I'm playing with fire. I'm aware that I'm frozen inside. I have known all along. So much more going on, no denying. But I know I'm not standing alone. You've been playing my mind through my wishes. You can feel that we're haunting the truth. Don't know I can't hold on always losing control. In the middle of the night. I don't understand what's going on. It's a world gone astray. In the middle of the night. I can't let it out. Someone keeps searching. And shatters your life. It will never be afraid. In the middle of the night. No more tears. No, 'cause nothing else matters. I've been closing my eyes for too long. Only vengeance will make me feel better. There's no rest 'till I know that it's done. You've been playing my mind through my wishes. You can feel that we're haunting the truth. Don't know I can't hold on always losing control. In the middle of the night. I don't understand what's going on. It's a world gone astray. In the middle of the night. I can't let it out. Someone keeps searching. And shatters your life. It will never be afraid. In the middle of the night. In the middle of the night. In the middle of the night. In the middle of the night. I don't understand what's going on. It's a world gone astray.

stairway to the skies,Seven seconds to the rise. Can't believe I'm still alive. And heaven was waiting for me. I thought this would be the end. But I know you'll understand. All that is keeping me here. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. I sense this time I may have changed. But one this still remains. I'm torn and the hate still lingers. I slowly start to realize. We won't reunite. I still have to march on through. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. Is it a curse or a fortune. Have I been blinded by regret. Redemption awaits. My soul is at stake. Will I find a stairway to the skies. In the end. I dream of a stairway to the skies. My angel is coming down from heaven to take me. I reach out but then you fade away. Whenever you call for me. Know that I'm only one step behind. Know that I'm only one step behind
stand my ground,"I can see. When you stay low nothing happens. Does it feel right ?. Late at night. Things I thought I put behind me. Haunt my mind. I just know there's no escape now. Once it sets its eyes on you. But I won't run, have to stare it in the eye. Stand my ground, I won't give in. No more denying, I got to face it. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside. If I don't make it, someone else will stand my ground. It's all around. Getting stronger, coming closer. Into my world. I can feel. That it's time for me to face it. Can I take it?. Though this might just be the ending. Of the life I held so dear. But I won't run, there's no turning back from here. Stand my ground, I won't give in. No more denying, I got to face it. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside. If I don't make it, someone else will stand my ground. All I know for sure is I'm trying. I will always stand my ground. Stand my ground, I won't give in, I won't give up. No more denying, I got to face it. Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside. If I don't make it, someone else will.

the cross,"Nothing's ever changed, you still turn away. You've washed your hands, you've made that all too clear. You just keep on living this lie.

All you see is how you want it to be. So you keep on living your life. Release me from this cross after all these years. Oh call my name and help me with this weight. Even though it comes far too late. I keep wondering why. I'm still calling your name through my tears. Why have you waited to embrace me my dear. Cold is your silence, denying what is real.

They've come to take our lifes away.. One by one they died.. A massacre that took all night. They had no chance, it was no fight. You can't kill what has been killed before,. They died.... With shadows on its tale.. He stepped through the portal,. locked the door and ate the key.. With his life they took their way to freedom,. and be became the final keeper of the key."

the howling,"We've been seeing what you want,. You've got us cornered right now. Falling asleep from our vanity. May cost us our lives. I hear them getting closer. Their howls are sending. Chills down my spine. Time is running out now,. They're coming down the hills from behind. When we start killing. It's all coming down right now. From the night that we've created. I wanna be awakened somehow. I wanna be awakened right now. When we start killing. It all will be falling down. From the hell that we're in. All we are is fading away. When we start killing. We've been searching on and on. But there's no trace to be found. It's like they all have just vanished. But I know they're around. I feel them getting closer. The howls are sending.

the last dance,"Yah yah yah yah yah hoh yah oh. Yah yah yah yah yah hoh oh – oh – oh – oh –oh (2x). She sent for you last night, she heard you were calling. Yearning in tears a thousand times. Her spirit was floating, the spirit was searching. On a cloud of dreams. A moonbeam shines bright in the city of Angels. Guilding the dreamers back to life. They’ill do the same every tomorrow. Till the pain subsides. Don’t be scared now. Close your eyes. She holds guard tonight. Go on forwad, no remorse. Life will take it’s course. Ye – ye – ye – ye yeah ohhhh yeah ohh. Ye – ye –ye –ye yeah ohhhh ohh (2x). She danced with you last night. So you will remember. All you have shared the life time. The angels were watching. And death will be waiting.

the last time,"For so long I've tried. Could not close my eyes. When you became an outcast in this life. Again and again I try. To understand the demons inside your head. But the truth is you love them to death. Now, I know it's. The last time I have tried. To lift you up to make you fight. Nothing is ever easy in life. I can't change it. If you don't have the will deep inside. I have been blind to how you justify. Everything that you've wasted in this life. Got lost in the illusion. I'd find a solution. For the demons in your head. But the truth is you love them to death. Now, I know it's. The last time I have tried. To lift you up to make you fight. Nothing is ever easy in life. I can't change it. If you don't have the will deep inside. You can blame and you can hide. Behind what is wrong and what is right. Life is the choices we make. I hope you'll awake before it's too late. Now, I know it's. The last time I have tried. To lift you up to make you fight. Nothing is ever easy in life. I can't change it. If you don't have the will deep inside"
the other half of me,"Over the hills, lies a new beginning. Over the hills. Over the hills, there is a way I know it. Over the hills. You can't bring all the gloom. Your heart is frayed and so empty. You glorify the future. Living in a different world than me. The journey ends in death. You are giving up so easily. You are the other half of me. Over the hills [4x]. We are drifting apart. Chilled to the marrow, cause you don't want to go. Cause we've got a different wish at heart. The amulet guides us to the other side. When I go down it's you who'll bleed. I'm not scared to die,. as long as I'm with you. You are the other half of me. Over the hills, lies a new beginning. Over the hills. Over the hills, there's a way I know it. Over the hills"
the promise,On behalf of her love. She no longer sleeps. Life had no longer meaning. Nothing to make her stay. She sold her soul away. I held you tight to me. You slipped away. You promised to return to me. And I believed. I believed. After the night he died. I wept my tears until they dried. But the pain stayed the same. I didn't want him to die all in vain. I made a promise to revenge his soul in time. I'll make them bleed down at my feet. I held you tight to me. You slipped away. You promised to return to me. And I believed. I believed. Sometimes I wonder. Could I have known about their true intentions?. As the pain stayed the same. I'm going to haunt them down all the way. I made a promise to revenge his soul in time. One by one they were surprised. I held you tight to me. You slipped away. You promised to return to me. And I believed. I believed
the swan song,"Winter has come for me, can't carry on. The chains to my life are strong,. but soon they'll be gone. I'll spread my wings one more time. Is it a dream?. All the ones I have loved calling out my name. The sun warms my face. All the days of my life, I see them passing me by. In my heart I know I can let go. In the end I will find some peace inside. New wings are growing tonight. Is it a dream?. All the ones I have loved calling out my name. The sun warms my face. All the days of my life, I see them passing me by. As I am soaring I'm one with the wind. I am longing to see you again,. it's been so long. We will be together again. Is it a dream?. All the ones I have loved calling out my name. The sun warms my face. All the days of my life, I see them passing me by"
the truth beneath the rose,"Give me strength to face the truth, the doubt within my soul. No longer I can justify the bloodshed in his name. Is it a sin to seek the truth, the truth beneath the rose?. Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heaven's door. I believed it would justify the means. It had a hold over me. Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast. It is the darker side of me. The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. Forgive me for what I have been. Forgive me my sins. Pray for me cause I have lost my faith in holy wars. Is paradise denied to me cause I can't take no more. Has darkness taken over me, consumed my mortal soul. All my virtues sacrificed, can Heaven be so cruel?. I believed it would justify the means. It had a hold over me. Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast. It is the darker side of me. The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. Forgive me for what I have been. Forgive me my sins. I'm hoping, I'm praying. I won't get lost between two worlds. For all I have seen the truth lies in between. Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done. Now that I know the darkest side of me. How can blood be our salvation. And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times. Will I learn what's truly sacred?. Will I redeem my soul, will truth set me free?. Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast. It is the darker side of me. The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen. Forgive me for what I have been. Forgive me my sins"
towards the end,The turn against. The world we know. Now our destiny. Will be decided. We have to send our brothers in arms. With pain in our heart. We watch them go. Will they return?. Truth is we have no choice. We'll try to shield those we can. No better world. Let this end. Mothers cry. Our boys die. But we'll stand 'til the end

where is the edge,"In the shadows it awakes the desire. But you know that you can't realize. And the pressure will just keep rising. Now the heat is on. Its too late, there is no way around it.

Of your darkest emotions?. Why does it all survive?. Where is the light. Of your deepest devotions?. I pray that it's still alive. It's the rule that you live by and die for.

There is no fear you'll ever give in to. You're untouchable. 'Cause you're losing your mind and you sleep. In the heart of the night. Where is the edge. Of your darkest emotions?. Why does it all survive?. Where is the light. Of your deepest devotions?. I pray that it's still alive. You can't stop yourself. Don't want to feel. Don't want to see what you've become.
